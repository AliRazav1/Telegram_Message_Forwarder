<h3>what does this script do ?</h3>

it will forward messages you sent to some chats automatically .

<h3>how can i use it ?</h3>

first of all you must go to my.telegram.org and register for getting api_id and api_hash
after those works you must complete login_credential file requirements such as api_id,api_hash,phone number and stuff like that ....


you can also use proxy (mtproto not supported because i used pyrogram ! )

after that create folders it can be one folder or more and add chats you wanna forward message to them automatically to those folders and add them to folder_name in login_credential config file ...

sleeping recommended for forwarding message , you can set that in randint_range in login_credential config file ...
set numbers bigger as soon as possible to prevent getting banned ....
my program will sleep a random number from range you get as input to my program ...

after doing that jobs do next jobs 

first of all go to saved messages of your telegram account then write /start for enable forwarding messages to chats that you added to folders you write in login_credential config file ...

after writing /start everything you send (except /stop) there will forward to chats ...
for disabling this mode you must send /stop in saved message and done [+]

i repeat my talking 
if you wanna prevent getting banned you must set range numbers bigger as soon as possible
